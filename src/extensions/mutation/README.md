# Mutable WadlerFest DOT

An extension to DOT that supports mutable references.

We recommend working with [`mutable-dot-simple`](https://github.com/amaurremi/dot-calculus/tree/master/src/mutation/mutable-dot-simple), which is based on our [simplified](https://github.com/amaurremi/dot-calculus/tree/master/src/simple-proof) DOT soundness proof.
We also (initially) extended the [original](https://github.com/samuelgruetter/dot-calculus) DOT soundness proof with mutation in [`mutable-dot-orig`](https://github.com/amaurremi/dot-calculus/blob/master/src/mutation/mutable-dot-orig.v).

For details on Mutable DOT and the proof see our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07610).
